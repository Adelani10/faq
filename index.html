            We do accept every kind of credit cards, but paying directly with cash speeds-up the transaction. Also, there could be some kind of hold-up while transacting with card, mainly due to network error, which could prompt you to be held back.

            Sadly, majority of people have indeed lost interest in agriculture. You see young people venturing into every form of tech- Blockchain, Web development, Product Designing, which isn't bad. However, we strongly believe that makes the Agricultural sector/field a Gold mine for people who are willing to take the risk of investing in it. So yes, we do support anyone into agriculture

            Making several of our delicious meals involve using both organic and inorganic ingredients to some extent. However, we wouldn't make use of any ingredients which could be in any way harmful to the health of our customers. Health is wealth!
